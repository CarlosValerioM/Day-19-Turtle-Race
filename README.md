## Description:
`turtle_race.py` is a simple Python script that simulates a turtle race. Each turtle moves at a random speed, and the first one to reach the finish line wins.

## How it Works:
1. The script initializes a race track with multiple turtles.
2. Each turtle is assigned a unique color and starts from the same position.
3. The turtles move forward at random speeds until one crosses the finish line.
4. The winner is announced in the console.

## Usage:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CarlosValerioM/Turtle-Race.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Turtle-Race
```
Run the script:
```bash
python turtle_race.py
```
Example Output:
```bash
The turtle red won the race!
